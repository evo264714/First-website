            <p>
                A hobby is the name of an activity that one does in his free time with passion, dedication, and joy. A
                hobby is a pastime activity loved by the people of all around the world. Every man around the world has
                his/her favorite past time activity called a hobby. Some people enjoy singing, dancing, traveling,
                cooking while others enjoy playing games, reading books or watching movies. These are all called
                hobbies. Playing cricket is my favorite hobby. Cricket makes you happy and healthy. Playing cricket
                involves a lot of physical exercises and activities. It is a healthy exercise with good physical and
                mental benefits. Playing cricket is not like a child play. It is liked only be active, alert and smart
                people. I have been playing cricket since childhood. In the initial days, I used to play with my peers
                in the streets. I really miss today the cricket of those days. I have learned from there and since then
                I am on the way of being a professional hitter batman. I have earned a good name in my circle because of
                cricket. I have helped my school cricket team to win annual inter-schools tournament thrice. I received
                a lot of appreciation and medals due to my best performance at various cricket matches. I am very much
                inspired by my Indian Cricket team. I like and wish for the way our hero Sachin Tendulkar plays. During
                my free time, I watch his past matches. It has greatly helped me in playing and performing well on the
                cricket ground. I have watched his live performance in a few cricket matches. I always aspire to become
                a man like him. Apart from Sachin, I am a huge fan of Ms Dhoni, Virat Kolhi, Rahul Dravid, Rahul Sharma,
                and other hitter and great bowlers of our country. We all love them because they are our pride when the
                beat other countries in cricket. Cricket is one of the most popular hobbies across the world. It is a
                wonderful hobby with a lot of physical and psychological benefits. It can become a good career though.
                But given the fact, a hobby is always a pastime activity. Therefore, a balance needs to be created
                between what you and what you need to do. Along with cricket, our study and career choice are also
                important. Therefore, friends should decide wisely.
            </p>
            <p> A person needs to achieve certain goals in one's life before you can call them successful. Success is to
                achieve goals, you have set. I have set certain goals I would like to achieve in my lifetime. Some of
                these goals are personal while others are professional. My professional goals in life are to find a good
                job that makes me happy, get a good education, find a job that makes enough money for me to support my
                family, and help people.
                Goals.
                It is very important for me to receive a good education. Most job fields require a descent education. If
                I don't have an education I would not be able to function properly at the work place and I would not
                understand what to do. To maintain a good job that will make good money will require me to go thorough
                schooling or training and maybe even both. Education is the first and foremost way to become successful,
                because the job I will choose will need me go to school and maybe even beyond college.
                .
                My happiness in what I do is also a goal for me I my life. There is no way someone can become successful
                if they are not happy with what they are doing. If their job is going to make them miserable, they will
                never show 100% in their work and they will slake off. If someone did this they would probably get fired
                or their pay would not be very high. The job I want will be interesting to me. I will need that I love
                my job and I love what I am doing. I need to be putting 100% into my work.
                .
                Another professional goal of mine is for me to be making good money in my work. I am not saying that I
                need to be making millions but I want enough so I can help support my family. I cannot expect to have a
                family I can't afford. My job will help me buy a home, pay health insurance, and other things I need for
                my family. My main goal in the money is to keep, my family happy. I want them to have enough but not too
                much. I want them to have the necessities.</p>
